# Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators

* == compares two values and returns true if they are the same string. False if not

* === compares two values and checks that they are the same data type returning true or false

* != compares two values and if they are not the same returns true otherwise it returns false

* !== checks to make sure that both data type and value are different

* && Both expressions have to be true for this to return true

* || If either expression is true this will return true

* ! This inverts the expression. If it was false it is now true


## Loops

* for loops - will execute the code in the loop 'x' amount of times

* while loop - will execute the code in the loop until a certain condition is met

* do-while loop - will execute the code in the loop as long as a certain condition remains true
