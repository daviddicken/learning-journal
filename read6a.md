# Dynamic Web Pages with Javascript

Today we used Javasript and used variables and grabbed the date with "new Date()" from that we parsed out the time using ".getHours".

Using the hour integer that we recieved we ran that through a if else statement to change the greeting variables string depending on what time of day it is.

all this was saved in a .js script and the script was ran from the .html page by putting this line

< script src="add-content.js" >< script >

 on the .html page were we wanted the script ran.
