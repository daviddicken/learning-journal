#HTML

When Designing a web site it is important to understand who the end user of your site is going to be.
You can ask yourself three questions:
Who? age, gender, cpu usage.
Why? Why are they visiting your site.
What? What do they need from your site.

#HTML5

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
Some of the elements are:
* < header>
* < footer>
* < nav>
* < article>
* < aside>
* < section>

These new elements provide clearer code vs. the older dev style of HTML.
