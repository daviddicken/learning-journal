**<u># Growth Mindset </u>**

Growth mindset is a way of thinking that allows you to always keep learning. 

To stay in a growth mindset I can always be looking for ways to improve a project or find a way to do it better.
I can remind myself that I know more today then yesterday and if I keep at it will know more tomorrow then today.
And lastley if Roger Googles so can I ;)
