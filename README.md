# **<u> Growth Mindset </u>**

## *Growth mindset is a way of thinking that allows you to always keep learning.* 

### To stay in a growth mindset 
1. I can always be looking for ways to improve a project or find a way to do it better.
2. I can remind myself that I know more today then yesterday and if I keep at it will know more tomorrow then today.
3. And lastly if Roger Googles so can I ;)
