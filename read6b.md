# How a Computer works.

## Tasks

All computers preform 4 different task.
They all
* input data
* store data
* process data
* output data

Input devices can be a keyboard, mouse, touchscreen mic, camera, sensors, ect.

Output devices can be a speaker, monitor, robot, ect.

## Data is store with electric wires

All data on a computer is just electric wires/switches that are either on or off. 
With just 32 wires a computer can store over 4 billion bits of data.

## Binary Number System
### Base10
Humans use a base10 number system 0-9 digits with the value of that digit increasing x 10 as it moves its placement. For example a 1 in the ones spot (1) is worth 1. If it is in the tens spot (10) it is worth 10 times what it was in the ones possition and if it is in the hundreds spot (100) it would be worth 10 times it's value it had in the tens spot ect, ect. To find the value of 694 you would multiply 6 x 100 = 600, 9 x 10 = 90, 4 x 1 = 4
Then add those products together to get 694
### Base2
A base2 (binary) number system works simular to our base10 except with only two digits 0 and 1. Instead of the value of a digit increasing by multiples of 10 it increases by multiples of 2.  So a 1 in the ones spot would be multiplied by 1 and a 1 in the next number spot would be multiplied by 2 and and the next spot by 4, next by 8 ect, ect.  To find the value of 1101 you would multiply 1 x 8 = 8, 1 x 4 = 4, 0 x 2 = 0, 1 x 1 = 1 Add those products together and you get 13.

It allways blows my mind to think about our number system and what it would be like if humans had been created with 11 fingers.
